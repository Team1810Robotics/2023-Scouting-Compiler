# 2023-Scouting Compiler

this is now set up to find all the csv files in a provided directory.
it only goes one deep so if you have any sub dirs in the main one provided then they will be ignored

the command i used to run this was `gradlew run --args="path/to/project/resources"`. easiest way is to drag the folder onto the terminal

(if on mac add a `./` in front of gradlew e.g. `./gradlew`)
